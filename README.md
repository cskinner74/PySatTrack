# PySatTrack

Simple python script to track satellites from the command line. New features to be added soon.

This script requires an API key, see n2yo.com for details

Edit rename samplesettings.conf to settings.conf and edit to store location data and API key

TODO:
* [ ] Add function to get location coordinates from gridsquare
* [ ] Simplify satellite selection
